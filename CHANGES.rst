Changes
=======

0.9.0 (2018-10-25)
------------------

Highlights
^^^^^^^^^^

* Fix Python 3.7 collections ABC classes deprecation warning. See `GH-55 <https://github.com/jaimegildesagredo/expects/pull/55>`.
* Hide ``expects`` internals from pytest tracebacks. See `GH-51 <https://github.com/jaimegildesagredo/expects/pull/51>`.

Backwards-incompatible
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Dropped Python 2.6 support.

0.8.0 (2016-05-15)
------------------

Changes since last stable release:

Highlights
^^^^^^^^^^

* New failure messages for matchers. Now its easier to see the reason that caused the assertion failure. For example::

    >>> expect([1, {'foo': 1}]).to(contain(have_key('foo', 2)))

    AssertionError:
    expected: [1, {'foo': 1}] to contain have key 'foo' equal 2
         but: item have key 'foo' equal 2 not found

Bug fixes
^^^^^^^^^

* Now the failure message for ``have_key``/``have_keys`` is fixed when composed with another matcher. See `GH-29 <https://github.com/jaimegildesagredo/expects/issues/29>`_.
* Allow ``contain``, ``contain_exactly`` and ``contain_only`` matchers to work with dict views (e.g. ``dict.keys()``). See `GH-42 <https://github.com/jaimegildesagredo/expects/issues/42>`_.
* Allow ``contain``, ``contain_exactly`` and ``contain_only`` matchers to work with sets. See `GH-38 <https://github.com/jaimegildesagredo/expects/issues/38>`_.
* Show traceback in ``raise_error`` when another exception is raised. See `GH-41 <https://github.com/jaimegildesagredo/expects/issues/41>`_.
* The ``equal`` matcher now uses ``__ne__`` for negated assertions. See `GH-40 <https://github.com/jaimegildesagredo/expects/pull/40>`_.
* The ``not_`` matcher now uses the inner matcher ``_match_negated`` method to perform a negated assertion.
* Python 2.6 support.

Backwards-incompatible
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Although your assertions should still be working (if are broken, just `report an issue <https://github.com/jaimegildesagredo/expects/issues>`_), the *custom matchers* api has been changed. To see an example of how to migrate your custom matchers to the new api you can see `the doublex-expects migration <https://github.com/jaimegildesagredo/doublex-expects/commit/f4908989298fbbaed46b59080d3a619a37f533fa>`_.

* The ``Matcher._match`` method now should return a tuple of ``bool`` representing the result of the matcher and a ``list`` of reasons that explain this result::

    def _match(self, subject):
        if subject:
            return True, ['a reason']
        return False, ['another reason']

* The ``Matcher._description`` method was removed. Now, with the change announced above, a matcher description won't need the subject to describe itself, so the ``__repr__`` magic method will be used instead to describe matchers.

* The ``Matcher._match_value`` method was removed. With the new api it made much less sense so it was removed and the ``expects.matchers.default_matcher`` wrapper function was added::

    >>> default_matcher(1)._match(2)
    False, ['was 1']


0.8.0rc5 (2016-05-07)
---------------------

Bug fixes
^^^^^^^^^

* Allow ``contain``, ``contain_exactly`` and ``contain_only`` matchers to work with dict views (e.g. ``dict.keys()``). See `GH-42 <https://github.com/jaimegildesagredo/expects/issues/42>`_.
* Allow ``contain``, ``contain_exactly`` and ``contain_only`` matchers to work with sets. See `GH-38 <https://github.com/jaimegildesagredo/expects/issues/38>`_.
* Show traceback in ``raise_error`` when another exception is raised. See `GH-41 <https://github.com/jaimegildesagredo/expects/issues/41>`_.

0.8.0rc4 (2015-10-14)
---------------------

Bug fixes
^^^^^^^^^

* Show the correct failure message on negated ``contain_exactly`` and ``contain_only`` matchers. See `GH-33 <https://github.com/jaimegildesagredo/expects/issues/33>`_.

0.8.0rc3 (2015-10-07)
---------------------

Bug fixes
^^^^^^^^^

* The ``equal`` matcher now uses ``__ne__`` for negated assertions. See `GH-40 <https://github.com/jaimegildesagredo/expects/pull/40>`_.
* The ``not_`` matcher now uses the inner matcher ``_match_negated`` method to perform a negated assertion.

0.8.0rc2 (2015-08-14)
---------------------

Bug fixes
^^^^^^^^^

* Python 2.6 support.

0.8.0rc1 (2015-07-17)
---------------------

Highlights
^^^^^^^^^^

* New failure messages for matchers. Now its easier to see the reason that caused the assertion failure. For example::

    >>> expect([1, {'foo': 1}]).to(contain(have_key('foo', 2)))

    AssertionError:
    expected: [1, {'foo': 1}] to contain have key 'foo' equal 2
         but: item have key 'foo' equal 2 not found

0.7.0 (2015-06-26)
------------------

Bug fixes
^^^^^^^^^

* `GH-26 <https://github.com/jaimegildesagredo/expects/issues/26>`_.

Bug fixes
^^^^^^^^^

* The ``contain_exactly`` matcher does not raise an ``IndexError`` if the subject list has fewer elements than the expected one. `GH-23 <https://github.com/jaimegildesagredo/expects/issues/23>`_.

0.7.1 (2015-06-09)
------------------

Bug fixes
^^^^^^^^^

* The ``contain_exactly`` matcher does not raise an ``IndexError`` if the subject list has fewer elements than the expected one. `GH-23 <https://github.com/jaimegildesagredo/expects/issues/23>`_.

0.7.0 (2015-03-01)
------------------

Highlights
^^^^^^^^^^

* Added ``have_len`` as an alias to ``have_length``.
* The ``have_len`` and ``have_length`` matchers can receive another matcher as expected value::

    expect('foo').to(have_len(be_above(2)))

* The ``contain`` and ``contain_exactly`` matchers now can receive another matchers as arguments::

    expect(['foo', 'bar']).to(contain(be_a(str)))
    expect(['foo', 'bar']).to(contain_exactly(be_a(str), match('\w+')))

* Improved ``be_a`` and ``be_an`` failure messages.
* Added the ``contain_only`` matcher::

    expect([1, 2]).to(contain_only(2, 1))

* Added the ``to_not`` alias for ``not_to`` to negate assertions::

    expect(True).to_not(be_false)

* Added the `aliases <http://expects.readthedocs.org/en/latest/aliases.html>`_ module with matcher aliases useful to compose matchers::

    from expects import *
    from expects.aliases import *

    expect([1, 2]).to(contain_exactly(an(int), 2))

Backwards-incompatible
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* The ``failure`` context manager now uses the ``end_with`` matcher as default matcher for failure message instead of the previously used ``contain`` matcher. Example::

    >>> from expects.testing import failure
    >>> with failure('foo'):
    ...     raise AssertionError('A foo message')
    AssertionError: Expected message 'A foo message' to end with 'foo'

    >>> with failure('message'):
    ...     raise AssertionError('A foo message')

0.6.2 (2014-12-10)
------------------

Bug fixes
^^^^^^^^^

* Fixed ``contain_exactly`` to work with iterable objects. Regression introduced in v0.6.1.

0.6.1 (2014-11-30)
------------------

Bug fixes
^^^^^^^^^

* Now the ``contain`` and ``contain_exactly`` matchers fail with a proper message when used with a non-sequence type. See `GH-21 <https://github.com/jaimegildesagredo/expects/issues/21>`_.

0.6.0 (2014-11-24)
------------------

Highlights
^^^^^^^^^^

* Now the ``raise_error`` matcher can be used without specifying an exception class for writing less strict assertions::

    expect(lambda: foo).to(raise_error)

* Implemented the ``Matcher._match_value`` method to help develop custom matchers that receive another matchers. See the `docs <http://expects.readthedocs.org/en/latest/custom-matchers.html#expects.matchers.Matcher._match_value>`_ for more info.

* The ``specs`` and ``docs`` directories are now distributed with the source tarball. See `GH-20 <https://github.com/jaimegildesagredo/expects/pull/20>`_.

0.5.0 (2014-09-20)
------------------

Highlights
^^^^^^^^^^

* Now the ``&`` and ``|`` operators can be used to write simpler assertions::

    expect('Foo').to(have_length(3) & start_with('F'))
    expect('Foo').to(equal('Foo') |Â equal('Bar'))

* The ``testing.failure`` context manager can be used even without calling it with the failure message as argument::

    with failure:
        expect('foo').to(be_empty)

* Also can receive matchers as argument::

    with failure(end_with('empty')):
        expect('foo').to(be_empty)

.. note:: See also backwards-incompatible changes for ``testing.failure``.

* Added the ``be_callable`` matcher.
* Published a list of `3rd Party Matchers libraries <http://expects.readthedocs.org/en/latest/3rd-party-matchers.html>`_.


Bug fixes
^^^^^^^^^

* The ``be_within`` matcher now supports float values.
* In some places ``bytes`` were not being treated as a string type in python 3.

Backwards-incompatible
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* The ``match`` matcher now passes if matches a part of the subject string instead of all of it. Previously used the :func:`re.match` and now uses :func:`re.search`. If your tests depended on this you can migrate them by adding a ``'^'`` and ``'$'`` at the beginning and end of your regular expression.
* The ``testing.failure`` context manager not longer tries to match regular expressions. Instead you can pass the ``match`` matcher with your regexp.

0.4.2 (2014-08-16)
------------------

Highlights
^^^^^^^^^^

* Added the ``not_`` matcher to negate another matcher when composing matchers.

0.4.1 (2014-08-16)
------------------

Bug fixes
^^^^^^^^^

* Now ``from expects import *`` only imports the ``expect`` callable and *built in* matchers.

0.4.0 (2014-08-15)
------------------

Warnings
^^^^^^^^

This release *does not* maintain backwards compatibility with the previous version because a *new syntax was implemented* based on matchers. Matchers have been implemented maintaining compatibility with its equivalent assertions (and those that break compatibility are listed below). For most users upgrade to this version will only involve a migration to the new syntax.

Highlights
^^^^^^^^^^

* Improved failure message for ``have_keys`` and ``have_properties`` matchers.
* The ``raise_error`` matcher now can receive any other matcher as the second argument.

Bug fixes
^^^^^^^^^

* The ``have_key`` and ``have_keys`` always fail if the subject is not a dict.
* Fixed ``contain`` matcher behavior when negated. See `this commit <https://github.com/jaimegildesagredo/expects/commit/b240f14256c72fb1c53619ce19392bb28da77d88>`_.

Backwards-incompatible
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* The ``end_with`` matcher should receive args in the right order and not reversed. See `this commit <https://github.com/jaimegildesagredo/expects/commit/3be83da4e0c335efa02931e19b30233e1021fec3>`_.
* The ``to.have`` and ``to.have.only`` assertions have been remamed to ``contain`` and ``contain_exactly`` matchers.
* Assertion chaining has been replaced by *matcher composition* in all places where was possible in the previous version.
* The ``testing.failure`` context manager now only receives a string matching the failure message.

0.3.0 (2014-06-29)
------------------

Highlights
^^^^^^^^^^

* The `start_with <http://expects.readthedocs.org/en/v0.3.0/reference.html#start-with>`_ and `end_with <http://expects.readthedocs.org/en/v0.3.0/reference.html#end-with>`_ assertions now support lists, iterators and ordered dicts. `GH-16 <https://github.com/jaimegildesagredo/expects/issues/16>`_.

Bug fixes
^^^^^^^^^

* Fixes a regression in the ``raise_error`` assertion introduced in v0.2.2 which caused some tests to fail. See `GH-17 <https://github.com/jaimegildesagredo/expects/issues/17>`_ for more info.

0.2.3 (2014-06-04)
------------------

Highlights
^^^^^^^^^^

* Added the `start_with <http://expects.readthedocs.org/en/v0.2.3/reference.html#start-with>`_ and `end_with <http://expects.readthedocs.org/en/v0.2.3/#end-with>`_ assertions. `GH-14 <https://github.com/jaimegildesagredo/expects/issues/14>`_.

0.2.2 (2014-05-20)
------------------

Bug fixes
^^^^^^^^^

* `to.raise_error` now works with a non-string object as second arg. See docs for `examples <http://expects.readthedocs.org/en/0.2.2/reference.html#raise-error>`_.

0.2.1 (2014-03-22)
------------------

Highlights
^^^^^^^^^^

* Added a `testing` module with the `failure` contextmanager.
* Added a `matchers` module and the `key` matcher.

Bug fixes
^^^^^^^^^

* `to.have` and `to.only.have` now work properly when actual is a string.

0.2.0 (2014-02-05)
------------------

Highlights
^^^^^^^^^^

* Added initial plugins support. See `plugins docs <http://expects.readthedocs.org/en/0.2.0/plugins.html>`_ for more info.
* The ``key`` and ``property`` expectations now return a new ``Expects`` object that can be used to chain expectations.
* Now every expectation part can be prefixed with ``not_`` in order to negate an expectation. Ex: ``expect('foo').not_to.be.empty`` is the same than ``expect('foo').to.not_be.empty``.
* Added the ``only.have`` expectation to test that the subject *only* has the given items.

Backwards-incompatible
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* The ``greater_than``, ``greater_or_equal_to``, ``less_than`` and ``less_or_equal_to`` expectations are renamed to ``above``, ``above_or_equal``, ``below`` and ``below_or_equal``.

0.1.1 (2013-08-20)
------------------

Bug fixes
^^^^^^^^^

* `to.have` when iterable items are not hashable (`Issue #8 <https://github.com/jaimegildesagredo/expects/issues/8>`_).
* `to.have.key` weird behavior when actual is not a `dict` (`Issue #10 <https://github.com/jaimegildesagredo/expects/issues/10>`_).

0.1.0 (2013-08-11)
------------------

Highlights
^^^^^^^^^^

* First `expects` release.
